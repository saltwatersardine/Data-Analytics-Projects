## üéØ Top 5 Highest-Paying Customers with Most-Spent Product

### üìå Overview
This query identifies the top 5 customers based on total amount spent, and shows the product each customer spent the most money on.

Understanding who your top-paying customers are ‚Äî and what products they value most ‚Äî helps marketing, sales, and strategy teams better target high-value segments and tailor offers to their preferences.

### üõ†Ô∏è How
The query:

- Finds the product each customer spent the most money on
- Combines both into a single, readable result

### üìä Results

**Total Spend Per Customer - Top 5**

```sql
SELECT
    customer_id,
    CONCAT(customer_first_name, ' ', customer_last_name) AS full_name,
    CAST(SUM(price * quantity) AS INT) AS total_purchase,    
    ROUND(SUM(COALESCE(coupon, 0)),2) AS total_discount,
    ROUND(SUM(price * quantity) - SUM(COALESCE(coupon, 0)), 2) AS total_spend, 
FROM
    orders
GROUP BY customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, 
ORDER BY total_spend DESC

## ‚úÖ What This Query Does

This query calculates overall spend for each customer.

### üìä Steps:

- Groups all orders by customer
- Calculates:
  - üí∞ `total_purchase`: The total value of items purchased (`price √ó quantity`)
  - üéüÔ∏è `total_discount`: The total discount applied using coupons
  - üßæ `total_spend`: Final amount paid, after subtracting coupon discounts

- Sorts the results by **total spend (after discounts)** in descending order

- Returns the **top 5 highest-spending customers**

### üß† Think of it like:
> "Who are my 5 biggest customers overall, and how much did they really spend after discounts?"

**Top Product by Customer Spend - Top 5**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        CONCAT(customer_first_name, ' ', customer_last_name) AS full_customer_name,
        CAST(SUM(price * quantity) AS INT) AS total_customer_purchase,    
        ROUND(SUM(COALESCE(coupon, 0)), 2) AS total_coupon_discount,
        ROUND(SUM(price * quantity) - SUM(COALESCE(coupon, 0)), 2) AS total_customer_spend,
        product_name
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, product_name
    QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY SUM(price * quantity) DESC
    ) = 1
) AS top_products
ORDER BY total_customer_spend DESC
LIMIT 5;
)
```

## ‚úÖ What This Query Does

This query analyzes customer purchase behavior and returns a ranked list based on total spend.

### üìä Steps:

- Looks at each customer‚Äôs purchases, **grouped by product**
- Calculates:
  - üí∞ Total amount spent on each product (`price √ó quantity`)
  - üéüÔ∏è Total discount applied (`coupon`)
  - üßæ Final spend after discount

- Finds the **one product** each customer spent the **most money on** (based on total price √ó quantity, before discount)

- Then it returns the **top 5 customers** who spent the most **after discounts**, and shows:
  - Customer name
  - Total purchase amount
  - Total discount
  - Final amount paid
  - The product they spent the most on

### üß† Think of it like:
> "Show me the 5 customers who spent the most, and tell me which single product they spent the most on."

Step 3: Join and return top 5 paying customers with their top product
```sql
SELECT
    ct.customer_id,
    ct.full_customer_name,
    ct.total_customer_purchase,
    ct.total_coupon_discount,
    ct.total_customer_paid,
    ctp.product_name AS most_spent_product,
    ctp.total_spent_on_product
FROM customer_totals ct
LEFT JOIN customer_top_product ctp
  ON ct.customer_id = ctp.customer_id AND ctp.rn = 1
ORDER BY ct.total_customer_paid DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
