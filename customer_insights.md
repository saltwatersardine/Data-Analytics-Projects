Step 1: Total spend per customer ranked top 5
```sql
WITH customer_totals AS (
  SELECT
      customer_id,
      CONCAT(customer_first_name, ' ', customer_last_name) AS full_customer_name,
      CAST(SUM(price * quantity) AS INT) AS total_customer_purchase,
      ROUND(SUM(COALESCE(coupon, 0)), 2) AS total_coupon_discount,   
      ROUND(SUM(price * quantity) - SUM(COALESCE(coupon, 0)), 2) AS total_customer_paid
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name

Step 2: Product each customer spent the most on Ranked Top 5
```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        CONCAT(customer_first_name, ' ', customer_last_name) AS full_customer_name,
        CAST(SUM(price * quantity) AS INT) AS total_customer_purchase,    
        ROUND(SUM(COALESCE(coupon, 0)), 2) AS total_coupon_discount,
        ROUND(SUM(price * quantity) - SUM(COALESCE(coupon, 0)), 2) AS total_customer_spend,
        product_name
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, product_name
    QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY SUM(price * quantity) DESC
    ) = 1
) AS top_products
ORDER BY total_customer_spend DESC
LIMIT 5;
)

    ct.total_customer_paid,
    ctp.product_name AS most_spent_product,
    ctp.total_spent_on_product
FROM customer_totals ct
