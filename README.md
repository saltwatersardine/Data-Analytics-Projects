# Data-Analytics-Projects

This repository contains a collection of my data analytics projects. Each project is contained within its own directory and includes the source code, data, a description of the project, and the results.

### Project List
1. [Bike-Share Data Analysis](https://github.com/saltwatersardine/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/Bike_Share_Data_Analysis_Case_Study_Using_R.md)
2. [Bellabeat Data Analysis](https://github.com/saltwatersardine/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/Bellabeat_Data_Analysis_Using_R.md)
3. [SQL Data Exploration](https://github.com/saltwatersardine/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/SQL_Data_Exploration.sql)


### Software

Projects in this repository will be analysed using the following software:

- `R` programming language and `RStudio` IDE
- `Python` programming language
- `SQL`and `BigQuery`
- `Excel`
- `PowerBI`
- `Tableu`

You will also need to have the following R packages installed:

- `tidyverse:` Helps wrangle data
- `ggplot2:` Helps visualize data
- `lubridate:` Helps wrangle data attributes
- `readr:` Helps import data ('csv', 'tsv', and 'fwf')
- `data.table:` Helps with large datasets
- `dplyr:` Helps manipulate data


You can install these packages by running the following code in R:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "lubridate", "readr", "data.table", "dplyr"))
```

Once packages are installed, you need to load them by running the library function:

```r
library(tidyverse, ggplot2, lubridate, readr, data.table, dplyr)
```
